[Week 8 SAS Recipe: recipe_for_isolating_all_duplicates]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Is this similar to our github workflow in which we work outside of the master through a fork? 
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) After going through various forums on sas it seems that this is common practice amongst many when trying different approaches to data sets.
* Question (yli110-stat660): What is the difference when isolating duplicates using first.variable and last.variable with BY statement, between using nodupkey/noduprecs?



[Week 8 SAS Recipe: recipe_for_drop_and_swap]
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Do we leave the values as characters to make the output readable for others or what is the purpose of leaving it as character?
