[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 3]

PROC FORMAT;
    VALUE $GENDERLABEL
	  "M"   = "Male"
	  "F"   = "Female";
RUN;
- Question (llopez37-stat660) If we did not put the dollar sign, would an error occur or would the name be considered numeric by sas?
* Question (yli110-stat660): What are rules for a format name to be valid in SAS?
* Answer (yli110-stat660):It must begin with a dollar sign if applies to character data, must be a valid SAS name, cannot be the name of an existing SAS format, cannot end in a number or period, can be up to 32 (numeric) or 31 (character) long.

- Answer(whu8-stat660): The new format’s name can’t end with a number, can’t end with a period, and can’t be the name of a SAS format. The name must begin with a dollar sign if used with a character variable.



[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 4]

- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Keywords are Low and High.  Note that Low does not include missing numeric values.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660):Where the semicolons should be placed in the "PROC FORMAT" statement ? 
- Answer (anguyen152-stat660): They are placed after these statement : The first statement calls PROC FORMAT. The second statement is a value clause that defines the name and contents of the user-defined format. The final statement is the run statement
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Why does the range only go from A to M? 
* Question (yli110-stat660): Why cannot VALUE range specifies both character values or numeric values?
* Answer (yli110-stat660): Because formats themselves are either character or numeric.
- Question (whu8-stat660):What are the types of value can be specified in the format value statement?

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 8]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What does the FORMAT procedure do?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): PROC FORMAT stores user-defined informats and formats as entries in SAS catalogs. Formats determine how variable values are printed.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): Why would you place a FORMAT statement in a DATA step ?

[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 1]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What are the default statistics produced by the MEANS procedure?
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): How many functions in total of the MEANS procedure ?

* Question (yli110-stat660): what are the default statistics produced by PROC MEANS?
- Question (whu8-stat660):What are the default statistics produced by the means procedure?
- Answer(whu8-stat660):N-count(without missing value), mean,minimum,maximum and standard deviation.



[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 2]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What is the difference between by and class statements in PROC MEANS?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): BY-group processing requires that your data already be sorted or indexed in the order of the BY variables. Also, the layout of BY-group results differs from the layout of CLASS group results.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): What is the word "BY" used for ?
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Are there conflictions with that can arise with using Var, by and class statements?

[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 4]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): Why would one chose BY over CLASS statement in PROC FREQ and PROC MEANS procedures?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Although the CLASS statement is easier to use than the BY statement because it does not require a sorting step, the BY-group processing can be more efficient when your categories might contain many levels.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): What is the pre-condition when using "By-group process" ? 
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Does the order effect how the table comes out?
* Question (yli110-stat660): What is the difference between CLASS statement and BY statement?
- Question (whu8-stat660):What’s the difference between ‘class’ and ‘by’ processing?
- Answer(whu8-stat660):Unlike class processing, by-group processing requires that your data already be indexed or sorted in the order of by variables. Sort procedure may be needed before proc means with a by group.



[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 7]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What does the asterisk do in PROC FREQ?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): The asterisk in PROC FREQ creates n-way crosstabulations.  
- Question (anguyen152-stat660):How to create list output for cross-tabulations in proc freq?
- Question (llopez37-stat660) What are the limitations for proc freq on both character and numeric variables if any?
- Answer (llopez37-stat660) It seems that the frequencies could be broken down for intervals on continous variables.
* Question (yli110-stat660): What type of variables are suitable for producing frequency tables?
- Question (whu8-stat660):If no variable is specified in the var statement, what would be the result for proc freq applied to a data set？
- Answer(whu8-stat660):There will be a frequency result table for each variables in the data set.



[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 8]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): Does order matter when listing it in PROC FREQ? Why?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Yes, order of the variable is important.  In n-way tables, the last two variables of the TABLES statement become the two-way rows and columns. Variables that precede the last two variables in the TABLES statement stratify the crosstabulation tables.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): Can Frequency distributions work with variables of all types of values?
- Question (llopez37-stat660) What approach could we take with non categorical variables?
* Question (yli110-stat660): Why are coninuous varaibles not suitable for producing frequency tables?
- Question (whu8-stat660):Can ID column be used in proc freq?
- Answer(whu8-stat660):It can be used in proc freq, but both continuous values and unique values will result in lengthy, meaningless tables.  



[Course Textbook Chapter 9, Problem 10]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What does the list option do in PROC FREQ?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Adding the LIST option puts the frequencies in a simple, short table.
- Question (anguyen152-stat660): What are the meanings of the words after the slash ?  
- Question (llopez37-stat660) How could we change the ranges of the weights to our choosing? 
* Question (yli110-stat660): How to produce crosstabulation tables in PROC FREQ?
- Question (whu8-stat660):What's the use of asterisk in a table statement?
- Answer(whu8-stat660):The asterisk is used to join the variables in a two-way tables statement.

* Question (yli110-stat660): What does ODS stand for? And what does ODS do?
- Question (whu8-stat660):If the class statement together with var used in the proc mean, both variables will be joined in the result table? 
- Answer(whu8-stat660):I think so, just like the use of asterisk in the proc freq.

- Question (anguyen152-stat660):How to make a new table storing the binned values ? 
- Question (llopez37-stat660) Do all the criteria for binning values have to be range values and not specific values?
* Question (yli110-stat660): What is the advantage of FORMATS in SAS?
- Question (whu8-stat660):Where does SAS save the online data files which is got from proc http function?
